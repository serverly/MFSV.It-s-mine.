# MFSV.It-s-mine

It just is a normal project for most of Github's members. But it is significant for me, just for me.
Now, I can say: "Hello, world."

2021.4.12 MFSV update to 1.2.1.0, can be used more conveniently.
 

After nearly a year and a half of coding and improvement, I believe I well realized my wish of winning a prize or an honor when I finished it.
However, school life is heavy, I won't have any other time to create any new things. But this code can also be called success. I haven't any regret, so this time may be the last update.
When you find me activating again, I believe I will code my new project in some new ways, maybe they are java or python even C++.
I hope that day can come soon but I couldn't ensure I will continue my dream energetically like today, maybe due to money, energy, healthy, and else.
But I won't leave forever, this can be truely ensured for me.

2021.7.11 MFSV update to New2.5.0.0,the birthday of me,also MFSV's.
That's all.
